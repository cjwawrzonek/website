    	<p><i>[Content warning: gender dysphoria, sexism, racial profiling]</i></p>
    	<h4 class="section">I. A workplace dispute</h4>
        
		<p class="tab">A recent conversation with a coworker of mine began over a case of workplace racial profiling and quickly evolved into a broader examination of assumptions in general. The most interesting and useful scenarios to talk about are ones that are not blatantly wrong or disrespectful, but instead walk a fine line, forcing us to examine exactly what we think is right and wrong about it. The scenario in question was listed as an example of discrimination on a company thread. It went like this (I’m paraphrasing because I don’t remember the exact wording):</p>

		<blockquote><i>“A coworker today asked me which visa I’m on despite me being a US citizen, born in the US. I assume this was because I’m racially Indian. When I mentioned that I’m from the US, he responded ‘Oh of course, I should have known. You don’t have an accent.’ “</i></blockquote>
		 
		<p class="tab">This situation involves a clear assumption on the part of the coworker asking the question (let’s call him Bob). Bob assumed that the coworker telling the story (let’s call her Alice) was from another country and was on a visa, which was an incorrect assumption. Before we examine this assumption, let’s examine the context. I work at a very large software company, and H1Bs are a big conversation topic given 1. the state of immigration under Trump, 2. the H1B lottery that took place a month ago and 3. the overwhelming number of foreign engineers that work there. My company hires a massive amount of engineers from foreign countries. My team of 12 people consists of 8 foreign nationals and visas are a regular topic. I would guess conservatively that around half of the engineers employed in my building are non US citizens. Non US employees are overwhelmingly Asian, usually Chinese, and Indian.</p>
		 
		<p class="tab">Given this context, it’s easier to see <i>why</i> Bob would have made that assumption. However, was it a <i>valid</i> assumption? It’s a difficult question to answer, but I am willing to concede that he did not have enough information to assume that and that it was rude. This led our discussion to the much more interesting question: when, if ever, is an assumption about a person valid? My coworker then took the untenable position that assumptions about another person’s identity, such as race or gender, are always invalid, which is where the discussion got heated.</p>
		 
		<h4 class="section">II. Assumptions are useful, obviously</h4>
		 
		<p class="tab">Let’s acknowledge for a moment how fundamental assumptions are to our daily lives. You wake up every morning assuming the sun will rise. You assume your toilet will flush. You assume your car hasn’t been stolen. You assume your car will start. You assume the road will be intact. You assume the barista at the coffee shop will speak English. You assume he/she will accept your dollar bills. And on and on and on. An assumption is simply an extrapolation of previous experiences to future events. Sure, they aren’t always correct. Perhaps your car breaks down. Perhaps the barista is an immigrant. Perhaps the sun exploded into a supernova while you slept. Despite not being correct 100 percent of the time, we rely on assumptions to function in the world around us. It is not unreasonable to assume that something that has held true the previous 100 instances will again be true in instance 101. This is fundamental to learning and predicting how the world will exist around us.</p>
		 
		<p class="tab">Consider for a moment how impossible life would be if you could not assume anything about the world. Every morning, you wake up (wow!) and preemptively call the plumber, auto mechanic, and police department because your toilet MIGHT not work, your car MIGHT not turn on and your car MIGHT have been stolen despite locking your garage. Of course, you can’t assume that the phone will work, so you set your alarm early in case you have to walk. Of course your alarm may not work, so you ask your friend to also set his alarm. Of course his alarm might not work, or he might change his mind, or he might not be your friend tomorrow, or he might murder you at night, or he might vanish into thin air…</p>
		 
		<p class="tab">This is a bit unfair because these are all easy assumptions. But it’s crucial to understand that assumptions are essential to making sense of the world around us. My coworker’s position was that assumptions about another person’s identity are always invalid. This is equally nonsensical. Just as we have to make assumptions about how the world works, we have to make assumptions about the people around us if we want to interact with them. You assume a coworker will speak English. You assume a friend will answer your calls when you’re stressed. You assume a man wearing a police uniform is a police officer. You assume a spouse won’t cheat on you. You assume a person with a thick accent is not a native speaker. If you couldn’t assume these things, social interactions would be impossible.</p>
		 
		<h4 class="section">III. What do we mean by validity?</h4>
		 
		<p class="tab">Ok, the obvious point that you’ve been screaming at the screen is probably “No shit assumptions are useful, but assuming somebody is from another country based on their race is wrong!” Right right, just as we have to make easy assumptions, we have to make difficult ones as well. So back to my original question, what makes an assumption valid? Statistically speaking the less likely something is true, the less valid the assumption is. If I buy a lottery ticket then blow my savings on a new car because I assume that I have an easy million waiting for me, that’s an invalid assumption. But there is another, more subtle dimension to measuring the validity of an assumption which is “what are the consequences of this assumption being incorrect and how does it affect those involved?” Consider these two examples:</p>
		 
		<ol>
			<li>A mother lets her 9 year old child play soccer after school to give her extra time at work. Let’s say hypothetically, 10 percent of the time, practice runs over. The coach sticks around until all kids are picked up, so there’s no danger to her arriving late to pick up her child. Still, she knows that it mostly ends on time, so she assumes it will end at 5pm and arrives then.</li>
		<li>A mother lets her 9 year old child walk home alone from school. The mother finds that about 100 kids walk home from that school each day, and there has <i>only</i> been 10 abduction-killings in the past 10 years in her neighborhood. 180 school days / year * 100 kids * 10 years - 10 murdered kids = 179,990 instances of safe kids out of 180,000. That is roughly a 99.994 percent chance that her child will make it home safe on a given day, or 99 percent chance that she can let her child do it for an entire year with no consequences. The mother assumes that her child will be safe.</li>
		</ol>
		 
		<p class="tab">Most parents would probably agree that the mother makes a valid assumption in scenario 1. Yet, most parents probably would not think she makes a valid assumption in scenario 2 even though 99.994 percent probability is pretty damn good for just about any bet. The assumption in scenario 2 is roughly 5,000 times more likely to be correct than the assumption in scenario 1, yet I would argue it’s less “valid” for a parent to make. The negative effects of being wrong in scenario 2 is a murdered child. The negative effects of being wrong in scenario 1 is sitting in the parking lot for an extra 15 minutes.</p>
		 
		<h4 class="section">IV. Assuming the harder stuff</h4>
		 
		<p class="tab">Now you’re probably screaming “How the HELL does abandoning a child have anything to do with making assumptions about somebody’s race?!” I’m getting there, I’m getting there. So we think that the validity of an assumption hinges both on the probability of it being true as well as the effects that making that assumption produces. Let’s reexamine the case of Bob and Alice given our new framework of validity. I’m going to make up some numbers that are roughly correct, though I apologize to HR in advance if this is wrong. I would wager that about 80 percent of racially Indian people in my office are also non US citizens. Thus, Bob met Alice and saw that she was Indian. He assumed she was a non US citizen and asked about her visa status. Was it valid to assume she is not a US citizen? A 4 in 5 chance of being correct is not bad. It’s about the same probability that my fridge will have beer in it when I go home, and I have no issue with skipping the corner store on my way back from the bus stop.</p>
		 
		<p class="tab">However, my coworker made a great point by describing the emotional toll and isolation that a person feels when they are identified as different because of their race. Should Alice be made to feel different so that Bob can save the question of asking if she is American 4 out of 5 times? My guess is that Bob was unfamiliar with this sort of isolation (just as I am as a white male), so he did not factor it into his assumption of rightness or wrongness when he asked about visa status. Given all this, I think it’s fair to say that if 20 percent of the time a question will hurt somebody - and not asking the question is a mionor inconvenience at best - it’s worth not asking it until we know more. If I meet a woman who’s particularly bloated in the belly, I won’t ask her “when’s it due?” on the very small chance that she is just overweight and not pregnant. It’s just polite, and I acknowledge that.</p>
		 
		<p class="tab">However, I believe there are cases where assumptions like this are valid. What if Alice did have an accent? Of those in my office who are ethnically Indian with strong accents, I have trouble thinking of a single person who is US born. The vast majority of US born citizens are native English speakers and the vast majority of people from India appear racially Indian. What if Alice is that rare one-in-a-million person who was raised in the Chicago suberbs, but is racially Indian and has a thick accent? Do I intentionally ask the other 999,999 people who fit this description “were you born outside the US?” to avoid alienating Alice? Would they be allowed to respond “of course I was dummy” or would that be insensitive to Alice as well? This brought us to the question, is it ever ok to assume something about somebody’s identity, racial or otherwise? My coworker said no. I then brought up gender identity and asked if it’s ok to assume this. She said no again. I identify as male and she refers to me by he/him, yet I never recall her asking me “do you identify as male?” Thus, she (correctly) assumed my gender identity as male, just as we both did for every other person in our office without conflict. In a bit of cognitive dissonance, she admitted that she was wrong for assuming I identify as male and apologized. I said that was fine, so long as she referred to every new person she meets from now on as “they” until explicitly told otherwise.</p>
		 
		<h4 class="section">V. The real problem is not the assumption</h4>
		 
		<p class="tab">Somewhere between 0.05 percent and 1 percent of the population likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria" target="_blank">suffers from gender dysphoria.</a> In addition, I would guess that those who suffer from gender dysphoria typically dress or act in a way that more closely aligns with their gender identity, indicating that it's not safe to assume their gender. Humans, like every animal, are very, very good at guessing the biological sex of another member of our species. It’s programmed into us. Thus, the probability of correctly assuming somebody’s gender identity from the way they dress and act is very high, likely over 99 percent. We all do it all the time, and it works really, really well. If somebody informs me that they identify as a different gender than I previously thought, I gladly accommodate them. But the tradeoff of beginning every conversation with “Hello, what gender do you identify with?” seems unnecessary given I can already tell the vast majority of the time. Of course, given that I don't have to deal with issues like gender dysphoria, it's possible that I'm unfairly discounting people's feelings.</p>

		<p class="tab">But the issue, as my coworker described it, seems to be that people feel like outcasts when these differences are made explicit. They feel as if these differences are not accepted. If that's the case, then we should strive to make these differences more socially acceptable. We should strive to accept and accommodate everybody’s preferences and corrections to our assumptions should be welcomed. Perhaps these corrections should become the norm for small talk instead of the weather. But we should not pretend as if these differences are not differences at all, that in fact nobody can tell whether you’re a man or a woman or that you have an accent or that you dress differently. We can all tell, and that’s absolutely fine. Real progress comes from learning to accept everybody despite these differences, not pretending that these differences do not exist in the first place.</p>
